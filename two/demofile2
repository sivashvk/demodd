Note that this seems to require running this command in each repo for that repo to be reset with the new credentials. Hopefully there is a global solution. –

This one perfectly worked for me. The above one with maximum vote didn't work. –

This is very insecure, not only does it allow anyone on the local system with read access to the local repo control over that repo, git remote -v simply discloses the key giving the attacker account wide access to your GitHub account. –

@ßãlãjî OS key managers and browsers take grate pains to secure credentials. Normal git workflow do not expose passwords or ssh private keys to other users with read access to a repo. The above advice does. It allows anyone with read access to a copy of a local repo, including for example a shared work or school filesystem, to see the user's clear text Personal Access Token. This extends to archived copies as well, such as source tarballs that retain the .git directory. –
